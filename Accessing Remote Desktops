*Data team remote desktops:
	• Tableau
		○ Hosts all ETL jobs for the data warehouse
		○ Currently only Adam Roberts, Larry Jerome, and Angela Morgan have access
	• KIPP-STATA-1 and KIPP-STATA-2
		○ Use this for large data processing jobs that cannot be run on your laptop
		○ Both of these desktops have instances of Stata, and can be used for analysis
		○ ***Need to establish a check-in/check-out system, because it is possible to kick some one off while in use, or forget that you are logged in***
